MAKEROM(1)                       User Commands                      MAKEROM(1)

NAME
       makerom - Compile files into C source code

SYNOPSIS
       makerom [options] files ... >output.c

       [--files fileList] [--name struct-name] [--mount mount-point] [--strip
       strip]

DESCRIPTION
       To enable files to be accessed on embedded systems without a file
       system, the makerom command converts arbitrary files into C code that
       can be compiled and linked into a program. This is useful for
       applications that must execute completely from ROM and not access a
       file system.  This facility can also enhance security by preventing the
       modification of files.

       The MPR portable runtime provides routines which can then read these
       files much as you would read any file on disk.

OPTIONS
       --files fileList
              Option to provide a list of files that should be converted.

       --p mount
              Specifies a mount point for the rom file system. This defaults
              to /rom.

       --name structName
              Specifies the name of top level C structure that holds the
              converted files.

       --p strip
              Specifies a filename prefix to strip from the start of each file
              name.

EXAMPLE
       This example will create a list of web files and then convert these
       files into C structures in the file romFiles.c.


           find web -type f -print >fileList

           makerom --files filelist >romFiles.c

           cc -o romFiles.o romFiles.c
